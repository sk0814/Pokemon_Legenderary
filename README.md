# Pokemon_Legenderary
The current repository is to classify the legendary pokemon. I am a big fan of pokemon as every other child is, if you are wondering what pokemon is, let me guide you to the pokemon world , it is a anime based on some fictional characters in a fantasy world where they were ranked based on  power,   rarity type strength battles trophies won.  
Apart from this stands a race called  Legendary pokemon in which they are treated as gods in pokemon world. So in our project I have a data set which is downloaded from offical  website. In this we have to predict what Pokemon status is, is it legendary or not. and Algorithms are chosen based on that.
